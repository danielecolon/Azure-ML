## Details
Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a powerful platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models in the cloud. In this session, we’ll take a practical, beginner‑friendly tour of the core concepts you need to get started. This is a brief overview, designed to help you understand what Azure ML offers and how you can begin using it in your own projects.
You’ll get an introduction to:

* What Azure Machine Learning is
* The Azure ML workspace and the basic tools available (Studio, SDK, CLI)
* How compute, data, and models are organized in Azure ML
* The general workflow for training and deploying a model
* Key concepts to help you explore further on your own

This session is meant to give you a solid foundation — not to cover every feature — so you leave with clarity, confidence, and a clear path for continued learning. New to machine learning? See how to make your first step with Azure ML Studio.
